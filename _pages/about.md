Background
======

My name is Sonata Kvedaravičiūtė. I was born in little village Papilys, Lithuania where I spend my beautiful childhood years and got my interest in all the sciences, but mostly in natural sciences. The phenomenon that occurs in the nature were fascinating me in since very early days, I could just stare how the flower blossoms in the morning and then it closes up in the evening. From the very early childhood learned to be humble and respectful with the nature around me. This trait of personality drives me very much into profound understanding of various nature phenomena, especially how the light and the matter interacts. With the mathematical models developed based on quantum mechanics formalism, we can empower ourselves to build a bridge between some very sensitive spectroscopic techniques and the phenomema we see in materials through the experiments.

Interests
======

I am fascinated by mathematical/computational modelling and how those models serve societal needs us in multiple ways. As a PhD student I appreciate a chance to explore the field of theretical and computational chemistry at more profound level. Currently, I work on some projects related to induced point dipole (IPD) polarizable embedding modeling. I am interested in new and efficient algorithms to model biomolecular systems and their properties. I really enjoy the development of methods - starting with deriving equations on paper, implementing an algorithm, optimizing it and testing. My interests are also oriented towards collaborations with people who do experimental work in spectroscopy field.
