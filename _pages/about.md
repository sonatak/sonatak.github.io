About me
======

My name is Sonata Kvedaravičiūtė. I was born in the small village of Papilys, Lithuania, a few years after the collapse of the Soviet Union. I am a part of the first generation of children born in independent Lithuania. However, my siblings were born in the same place but in different countries.

Growing up in a village where life was deeply intertwined with nature, I was surrounded by hardworking people who taught me the value of labor and the rhythms of the seasons. Witnessing the changing landscapes and the impact of natural phenomena, I understood how profoundly our lives are influenced by the natural world despite our efforts to resist it.

From a very early age, I learned to be humble and respectful of the nature around me. This trait drives my profound understanding of various natural phenomena and led me to pursue a PhD in Physical Chemistry. During my PhD years, I also developed an interest in High-Performance Computing and explored ways to facilitate understanding of natural phenomena by efficiently exploiting computational power.
