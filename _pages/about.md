Welcome to my academic webpage

Background
======

My name is Sonata Kvedaravičiūtė. I was born in little village Papilys, Lithuania where I spend my beautiful childhood years and got my interest in all the sciences, but mostly in natural sciences. The phenomenon that occurs in the nature were fascinating me in since very early days, I could just stare how the flower blossoms in the morning and then it closes up in the evening. From the very early childhood learned to be humble and respectful with the nature around me. This trait of personality drives me very much into profound understanding of various nature phenomena, especially how the light and the matter interacts. With the mathematical models developed based on quantum mechanics formalism, we can empower ourselves to build a bridge between some very sensitive spectroscopic techniques and 

Interests
======

As a PhD student I appreciate a chance to explore the field of theretical and computational chemistry at more profound level. I am fascinated about establishing a bridge between the theory and experiment. Especially when we talk about complex biomolecular systems. The phenomenon that occurs in the nature were fascinating me in since very early days, I could just stare how the flower blossoms in the morning and then it closes up in the evening. From the very early childhood learned to be humble and respectful with the nature around me. This trait of personality drives me very much into profound understanding of various nature phenomena, especially how the light and the matter interacts. With the mathematical models developed based on quantum mechanics formalism, we can empower ourselves to build a bridge between some very sensitive spectroscopic techniques and the theoretical models to explain it and predict spectroscopic properties. 

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
